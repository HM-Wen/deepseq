----------------------------------------------------

Description:
------------
    edgeR can be used as a web service embedded in a Galaxy instance. 
    We call it as edgeR-hts. 

Requirements:
-------------
    MATLAB/OCTAVE and Python :- Preprocessing of sequencing reads and GFF files
    R, Bio-conductor package :- Required for edgeR
    SCIPY, NUMPY :- for python  
    SAMTOOLS :- Sequencing read processing 

Contents:
---------

Getting started:
----------------
    Check for all requirements first, then

    a) Run ./setup_edgeR-hts.sh and setup paths and configuration options for edgeR-hts.

    b) Inside the mex folder execute the make file to create platform dependent .mex files 
	    cd mex/Makefile 
	    make [interpreter] 
            make octave for octave 
            make matlab for matlab 
            make all for octave and matlab 

    c) Edit the Galaxy tool configuration file to adjust the path if necessary.
